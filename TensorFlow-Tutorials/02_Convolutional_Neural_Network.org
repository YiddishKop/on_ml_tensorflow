#+TITLE: TensorFlow Tutorial #02

* Convolutional Neural Network
** Introduction
*** fully connected NN vs. CNN
The previous tutorial showed that a simple linear model had about *91%*
classification accuracy for recognizing hand-written digits in the MNIST
data-set.

In this tutorial we will implement *a simple Convolutional Neural Network* in
TensorFlow which has a *classification accuracy* of about *99%*, or more if you
make some of the suggested exercises.

*** what's the essential trait of CNN
*Convolutional Networks* work by

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
*moving small filters across the input image*.

This means the *filters* are *re-used for recognizing patterns* throughout the
entire input image.
#+END_QUOTE

This makes the *Convolutional Networks* much more powerful than
*Fully-Connected* networks with the same number of variables. This in turn makes
the Convolutional Networks faster to train.

** Flowchart

The following chart shows roughly how the data flows in the Convolutional Neural
Network that is implemented below.

file:images/02_network_flowchart.png

*** 1st convolutional layer
'filter-weights' also can be called 'pattern-filter'.

The input image is processed in the *first convolutional layer* using the
*filter-weights*. This results in *16* new images, one for each filter in the
convolutional layer. The images are also *down-sampled* so the image resolution
is decreased from *28x28* to *14x14*.

*** 2nd convolutional layer
These 16 smaller images are then processed in the *second convolutional layer*.
We need *filter-weights* for each of these *16* channels, and we need
*filter-weights* for each output channel of this layer. There are *36* output
channels so there are a total of *16 x 36 = 576* filters in the second
convolutional layer. The resulting images are down-sampled again to *7x7*
pixels.

*** fully connected layer
The output of the second convolutional layer is 36 images of *7x7* pixels each.
These are then flattened to a single vector of length *7 x 7 x 36 = 1764*, which
is used as the input to a fully-connected layer with 128 neurons (or elements).
This feeds into another fully-connected layer with 10 neurons, one for each of
the classes, which is used to determine the class of the image, that is, which
number is depicted in the image.

*** how filters created and update
The convolutional filters are *initially chosen at random*, so the
classification is done randomly.

The error between the predicted and true class of the input image is measured as
the so-called *cross-entropy*. The optimizer then automatically propagates this
error back through the Convolutional Network using the chain-rule of
differentiation and updates the *filter-weights* so as to improve the
classification error. This is done iteratively thousands of times until the
classification error is sufficiently low.

These particular filter-weights and intermediate images are the results of one
optimization run and may look different if you re-run this Notebook.

Note that the computation in TensorFlow is actually done *on a batch of images*
instead of a single image, which makes the computation more efficient. This
means the flowchart actually has one more data-dimension when implemented in
TensorFlow.

** Convolutional Layer
file:images/02_convolution.png

*** how filter works
The following chart shows the basic idea of processing an image in the first
convolutional layer. The input image depicts the number 7 and four copies of the
image are shown here, so we can see more clearly how the filter is being moved
to different positions of the image. For *each position of the filter*, the
*dot-product* is being calculated between the filter and the image pixels under
the filter, which *results in a single pixel* in the output image. So moving the
filter across the entire input image *results in a new image* being generated. â€‹

*** means of colors
- red filter-weights means that the filter has a positive reaction to black
  pixels in the input image
- blue pixels means the filter has a negative reaction to black pixels.

In this case it appears that the filter recognizes the *horizontal line* of the
7-digit, as can be seen from its stronger reaction to that line in the output
image.

*** stride: the length of filter moves per time
The step-size for moving the filter across the input is called the stride. There
is a

- stride for moving the filter horizontally (x-axis)
- another stride for moving vertically (y-axis).

In the source-code below, the stride is set to *1* in both directions, which
means the filter starts in the upper left corner of the input image and is being
moved 1 pixel to the right in each step. When the filter reaches the end of the
image to the right, then the filter is moved back to the left side and 1 pixel
down the image. This continues until the filter has reached the lower right
corner of the input image and the entire output image has been generated.

*** padding
When the filter reaches the end of the right-side as well as the bottom of the
input image, then it can be *padded with zeroes* (white pixels). This causes the
*output image* to be of the *exact same dimension* as the input image.

*** ReLU and max-pooling
Furthermore, the output of the convolution may be passed through a so-called
*Rectified Linear Unit* (ReLU), which merely ensures that the output is positive
because *negative values are set to zero*. The output may also be down-sampled
by so-called *max-pooling*, which considers small windows of *2x2* pixels and
only keeps the largest of those pixels. This halves the resolution of the input
image e.g. from 28x28 to 14x14 pixels.

Note that the second convolutional layer is more complicated because it takes 16
input channels. We want a separate filter for each input channel, so we need 16
filters instead of just one. Furthermore, we want 36 output channels from the
second convolutional layer, so in total we need 16 x 36 = 576 filters for the
second convolutional layer. It can be a bit challenging to understand how this
works.

* TensorFlow Graph
** Introduction
The entire purpose of TensorFlow is to have a so-called computational graph that
can be executed much more efficiently than if the same calculations were to be
performed directly in Python. TensorFlow can be more efficient than NumPy
because TensorFlow knows the entire computation graph that must be executed,
while NumPy only knows the computation of a single mathematical operation at a
time.

TensorFlow can also automatically calculate the gradients that are needed to
optimize the variables of the graph so as to make the model perform better. This
is because the graph is a combination of simple mathematical expressions so the
gradient of the entire graph can be calculated using the chain-rule for
derivatives.

TensorFlow can also take advantage of multi-core CPUs as well as GPUs - and
Google has even built special chips just for TensorFlow which are called TPUs
(Tensor Processing Units) and are even faster than GPUs.

A TensorFlow graph consists of the following parts which will be detailed below:

  - Placeholder variables used for inputting data to the graph.
  - Variables that are going to be optimized so as to make the convolutional network perform better.
  - The mathematical formulas for the convolutional network.
  - A cost measure that can be used to guide the optimization of the variables.
  - An optimization method which updates the variables.

In addition, the TensorFlow graph may also contain various debugging statements
e.g. for logging data to be displayed using TensorBoard, which is not covered in
this tutorial.
** Helper functions
*** Helper-function for creating new variables
 Functions for creating new TensorFlow variables in the given shape and
 initializing them with random values. Note that *the initialization is not
 actually done at this point*, it is merely being defined in the TensorFlow
 graph.

*** Helper-function for creating a new Convolutional Layer
 This function creates a new convolutional layer in the computational graph for
 TensorFlow. Nothing is actually calculated here, we are just adding the
 mathematical formulas to the TensorFlow graph.

 It is assumed that the input is a 4-dim tensor with the following dimensions:

   - Image number.
   - Y-axis of each image.
   - X-axis of each image.
   - Channels of each image.

 Note that the input channels may either be colour-channels, or it may be
 filter-channels if the input is produced from a previous convolutional layer.

 The output is another 4-dim tensor with the following dimensions:

   - Image number, same as input.
   - Y-axis of each image. If 2x2 pooling is used, then the height and width of the input images is divided by 2.
   - X-axis of each image. Ditto.
   - Channels produced by the convolutional filters.

 #+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
 def new_conv_layer(input,              # The previous layer.
                    num_input_channels, # Num. channels in prev. layer.
                    filter_size,        # Width and height of each filter.
                    num_filters,        # Number of filters.
                    use_pooling=True):  # Use 2x2 max-pooling.

     # Shape of the filter-weights for the convolution.
     # This format is determined by the TensorFlow API.
     shape = [filter_size, filter_size, num_input_channels, num_filters]

     # Create new weights aka. filters with the given shape.
     weights = new_weights(shape=shape)

     # Create new biases, one for each filter.
     biases = new_biases(length=num_filters)

     # Create the TensorFlow operation for convolution.
     # Note the strides are set to 1 in all dimensions.
     # The first and last stride must always be 1,
     # because the first is for the image-number and
     # the last is for the input-channel.
     # But e.g. strides=[1, 2, 2, 1] would mean that the filter
     # is moved 2 pixels across the x- and y-axis of the image.
     # The padding is set to 'SAME' which means the input image
     # is padded with zeroes so the size of the output is the same.
     layer = tf.nn.conv2d(input=input,
                          filter=weights,
                          strides=[1, 1, 1, 1],
                          padding='SAME')

     # Add the biases to the results of the convolution.
     # A bias-value is added to each filter-channel.
     layer += biases

     # Use pooling to down-sample the image resolution?
     if use_pooling:
         # This is 2x2 max-pooling, which means that we
         # consider 2x2 windows and select the largest value
         # in each window. Then we move 2 pixels to the next window.
         layer = tf.nn.max_pool(value=layer,
                                ksize=[1, 2, 2, 1],
                                strides=[1, 2, 2, 1],
                                padding='SAME')

     # Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU).
     # It calculates max(x, 0) for each input pixel x.
     # This adds some non-linearity to the formula and allows us
     # to learn more complicated functions.
     layer = tf.nn.relu(layer)

     # Note that ReLU is normally executed before the pooling,
     # but since relu(max_pool(x)) == max_pool(relu(x)) we can
     # save 75% of the relu-operations by max-pooling first.

     # We return both the resulting layer and the filter-weights
     # because we will plot the weights later.

*** Helper-function for flattening a layer
 A convolutional layer produces an output tensor with 4 dimensions. We will add
 fully-connected layers after the convolution layers, so we need to reduce the
 4-dim tensor to 2-dim which can be used as input to the fully-connected layer.

 #+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
 def flatten_layer(layer):
     # Get the shape of the input layer.
     layer_shape = layer.get_shape()

     # The shape of the input layer is assumed to be:
     # layer_shape == [num_images, img_height, img_width, num_channels]

     # The number of features is: img_height * img_width * num_channels
     # We can use a function from TensorFlow to calculate this.
     num_features = layer_shape[1:4].num_elements()

     # Reshape the layer to [num_images, num_features].
     # Note that we just set the size of the second dimension
     # to num_features and the size of the first dimension to -1
     # which means the size in that dimension is calculated
     # so the total size of the tensor is unchanged from the reshaping.
     layer_flat = tf.reshape(layer, [-1, num_features])

     # The shape of the flattened layer is now:
     # [num_images, img_height * img_width * num_channels]

     # Return both the flattened layer and the number of features.
     return layer_flat, num_features
 #+END_SRC

 #+RESULTS:
 :RESULTS:
 # Out[17]:
 :END:

*** Helper-function for creating a new Fully-Connected Layer
 This function creates a new fully-connected layer in the computational graph for
 TensorFlow. Nothing is actually calculated here, we are just adding the
 mathematical formulas to the TensorFlow graph.

 It is assumed that the input is a 2-dim tensor of shape [num_images,
 num_inputs]. The output is a 2-dim tensor of shape [num_images, num_outputs].

 #+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer

                    num_outputs,    # Num. outputs.
                    use_relu=True): # Use Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)?

       # Create new weights and biases.

       biases = new_biases(length=num_outputs)

       # the input and weights, and then add the bias-values.

** Placeholder variables
Placeholder variables serve as the input to the TensorFlow computational graph
that we may change each time we execute the graph. We call this feeding the
placeholder variables and it is demonstrated further below.

First we define the placeholder variable for the input images. This allows us to
change the images that are input to the TensorFlow graph. This is a so-called
tensor, which just means that it is a multi-dimensional vector or matrix. The
data-type is set to float32 and the shape is set to [None, img_size_flat], where
None means that the tensor may hold an arbitrary number of images with each
image being a vector of length *img_size_flat*.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, img_size_flat], name='x')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[19]:
:END:

The convolutional layers expect x to be encoded as a 4-dim tensor so we have to
reshape it so its shape is instead [num_images, img_height, img_width,
num_channels]. Note that img_height $==$ img_width $==$ img_size and num_images
can be inferred automatically by using -1 for the size of the first dimension.
So the reshape operation is:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
x_image = tf.reshape(x, [-1, img_size, img_size, num_channels])
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[21]:
:END:

Next we have the placeholder variable for the true labels associated with the
images that were input in the placeholder variable x. The shape of this
placeholder variable is [None, num_classes] which means *it may hold an
arbitrary number of labels* and *each label is a vector of length num_classes
which is 10 in this case*.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
y_true = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, num_classes], name='y_true')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[22]:
:END:

We could also have a placeholder variable for the class-number, but we will
instead calculate it using argmax. Note that this is a TensorFlow operator so
nothing is calculated at this point.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
y_true_cls = tf.argmax(y_true, axis=1)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[23]:
:END:

** Convolutional Layer 1
Create the first convolutional layer. It takes ~x_image~ as input and creates
~num_filters1~ different filters, each having width and height equal to
~filter_size1~. Finally we wish to *down-sample* the image so it is half the
size by using 2x2 max-pooling.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
layer_conv1, weights_conv1 = \
    new_conv_layer(input=x_image,
                   num_input_channels=num_channels,
                   filter_size=filter_size1,
                   num_filters=num_filters1,
                   use_pooling=True)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[24]:
:END:

Check the shape of the tensor that will be output by the convolutional layer. It
is (?, 14, 14, 16) which means that there is an arbitrary number of images (this
is the ?), each image is 14 pixels wide and 14 pixels high, and there are 16
different channels, one channel for each of the filters.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer

:END:

<tf.Tensor 'Relu:0' shape=(?, 14, 14, 16) dtype=float32>

** Convolutional Layer 2
Create the second convolutional layer, which takes as input the output from the
first convolutional layer. The number of input channels corresponds to the
number of filters in the first convolutional layer.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
layer_conv2, weights_conv2 = \
    new_conv_layer(input=layer_conv1,
                   num_input_channels=num_filters1,
                   filter_size=filter_size2,
                   num_filters=num_filters2,
                   use_pooling=True)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[26]:
:END:

Check the shape of the tensor that will be output from this convolutional layer.
The shape is (?, 7, 7, 36) where the ? again means that there is an arbitrary
number of images, with each image having width and height of 7 pixels, and there
are 36 channels, one for each filter.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer

:END:

<tf.Tensor 'Relu_1:0' shape=(?, 7, 7, 36) dtype=float32>

** Flatten Layer
The convolutional layers output 4-dim tensors. We now wish to use these as input
in a fully-connected network, which requires for the tensors to be reshaped or
flattened to 2-dim tensors.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
layer_flat, num_features = flatten_layer(layer_conv2)

relations.

** Predicted Class after softmax
The second fully-connected layer estimates how likely it is that the input image
belongs to each of the 10 classes. However, these estimates are a bit rough and
difficult to interpret because the numbers may be very small or large, so we
want to *normalize* them so that each element is *limited between zero and one*
and the 10 elements sum to one. This is calculated using the so-called *softmax*
function and the result is stored in *y_pred*.

** Cost-function to be optimized

*** evalute how well the model is by now
To make the model better at classifying the input images, we must somehow change
the variables for all the network layers. To do this we first need to know *how
well the model currently performs* by comparing the predicted output of the
model y_pred to the desired output y_true.

*** cross_entropy
The *cross-entropy* is a performance measure used in *classification*. The
cross-entropy is a continuous function that is always positive and if the
predicted output of the model exactly matches the desired output then the
cross-entropy equals zero. The goal of optimization is therefore to minimize the
cross-entropy so it gets as close to zero as possible by changing the variables
of the network layers.

TensorFlow has a built-in function for calculating the cross-entropy. Note that
the function calculates the softmax internally so we must use the output of
~layer_fc2~ directly *rather than y_pred* which has already had the softmax
applied.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
cross_entropy = tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits=layer_fc2,
                                                        labels=y_true)

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[37]:
:END:

We have now calculated the cross-entropy for each of the image classifications
so we have a measure of how well the model performs on each image individually.
But in order to use the cross-entropy to guide the optimization of the model's
variables we need a single scalar value, so we simply take the average of the
cross-entropy for all the image classifications.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
cost = tf.reduce_mean(cross_entropy)

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[38]:
:END:

** Optimization Method
Now that we have a *cost measure that must be minimized*, we can then create an
optimizer. In this case it is the AdamOptimizer which is an advanced form of
*Gradient Descent*.

Note that optimization is not performed at this point. In fact, nothing is
calculated at all, we just add the optimizer-object to the TensorFlow graph for
later execution.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer(learning_rate=1e-4).minimize(cost)

** Performance Measures
We need a few more performance measures to display the progress to the user.

This is a vector of booleans whether the predicted class equals the true class
of each image.

correct_prediction = tf.equal(y_pred_cls, y_true_cls)

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[40]:
:END:

This calculates the classification accuracy by first type-casting the vector of
booleans to floats, so that False becomes 0 and True becomes 1, and then
calculating the average of these numbers.

** Helper-function to perform optimization iterations
There are *55,000* images in the training-set. It takes a long time to calculate
the gradient of the model using all these images. We therefore only use a small
batch of images in each iteration of the optimizer.

If your computer crashes or becomes very slow because you run out of RAM, then
you may try and lower this number, but you may then need to perform more
optimization iterations.

* Visualization weights

In trying to understand why the convolutional neural network can recognize
handwritten digits, we will now visualize the weights of the convolutional
filters and the resulting output images.

** Convolution Layer 1
Now plot the filter-weights for the first convolutional layer.

Note that positive weights are red and negative weights are blue.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
plot_conv_weights(weights=weights_conv1)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[65]:

:END:

Applying each of these convolutional filters to the first input image gives the
following output images, which are then used as input to the second
convolutional layer. Note that these images are down-sampled to 14 x 14 pixels
which is half the resolution of the original input image.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
plot_conv_layer(layer=layer_conv1, image=image1)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[66]:
[[file:./obipy-resources/6119xp2.png]]
:END:

The following images are the results of applying the convolutional filters to
the second image.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
plot_conv_layer(layer=layer_conv1, image=image2)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[67]:
[[file:./obipy-resources/6119jzF.png]]
:END:

It is difficult to see from these images what the purpose of the convolutional
filters might be. It appears that they have merely created several variations of
the input image, as if light was shining from different angles and casting
shadows in the image.

** Convolution Layer 2
Now plot the filter-weights for the second convolutional layer.

There are 16 output channels from the first conv-layer, which means there are 16
input channels to the second conv-layer. The second conv-layer has a set of
filter-weights for each of its input channels. We start by plotting the
filter-weigths for the first channel.

Note again that positive weights are red and negative weights are blue.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
plot_conv_weights(weights=weights_conv2, input_channel=0)

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[68]:
[[file:./obipy-resources/6119w9L.png]]
:END:

There are 16 input channels to the second convolutional layer, so we can make
another 15 plots of filter-weights like this. We just make one more with the
filter-weights for the second channel.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
plot_conv_weights(weights=weights_conv2, input_channel=1)

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[69]:
[[file:./obipy-resources/61199HS.png]]
:END:

It can be difficult to understand and keep track of how these filters are
applied because of the high dimensionality.

Applying these convolutional filters to the images that were ouput from the
first conv-layer gives the following images.

Note that these are down-sampled yet again to 7 x 7 pixels which is half the
resolution of the images from the first conv-layer.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
plot_conv_layer(layer=layer_conv2, image=image1)

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[70]:
[[file:./obipy-resources/6119KSY.png]]
:END:

And these are the results of applying the filter-weights to the second image.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
plot_conv_layer(layer=layer_conv2, image=image2)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
# Out[71]:
[[file:./obipy-resources/6119Xce.png]]
:END:

From these images, it looks like the second convolutional layer might detect
lines and patterns in the input images, which are less sensitive to local
variations in the original input images.

These images are then flattened and input to the fully-connected layer, but that
is not shown here.

** Close TensorFlow Session
We are now done using TensorFlow, so we close the session to release its
resources.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session :exports both :async t :results raw drawer
# This has been commented out in case you want to modify and experiment
# with the Notebook without having to restart it.
# session.close()
#+END_SRC

** Conclusion
We have seen that a Convolutional Neural Network works much better at
recognizing hand-written digits than the simple linear model in Tutorial #01.
The Convolutional Network gets a classification accuracy of about 99%, or even
more if you make some adjustments, compared to only 91% for the simple linear
model.

However, the Convolutional Network is also much more complicated to implement,
and it is not obvious from looking at the filter-weights why it works and why it
sometimes fails.

So we would like an easier way to program Convolutional Neural Networks and we
would also like a better way of visualizing their inner workings.

** Exercises
These are a few suggestions for exercises that may help improve your skills with
TensorFlow. It is important to get hands-on experience with TensorFlow in order
to learn how to use it properly.

You may want to backup this Notebook before making any changes.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
- Do you get the exact same results if you run the Notebook multiple times without changing any parameters? What are the sources of randomness?
- Run another 10,000 optimization iterations. Are the results better?
- Change the learning-rate for the optimizer.
- Change the configuration of the layers, such as the number of convolutional filters, the size of those filters, the number of neurons in the fully-connected layer, etc.
- Add a so-called drop-out layer after the fully-connected layer. Note that the drop-out probability should be zero when calculating the classification accuracy, so you will need a placeholder variable for this probability.
- Change the order of ReLU and max-pooling in the convolutional layer. Does it calculate the same thing? What is the fastest way of computing it? How many calculations are saved? Does it also work for Sigmoid-functions and average-pooling?
- Add one or more convolutional and fully-connected layers. Does it help performance?
- What is the smallest possible configuration that still gives good results?
- Try using ReLU in the last fully-connected layer. Does the performance change? Why?
- Try not using pooling in the convolutional layers. Does it change the classification accuracy and training time?
- Try using a 2x2 stride in the convolution instead of max-pooling? What is the difference?
- Remake the program yourself without looking too much at this source-code.
- Explain to a friend how the program works.
